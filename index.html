<p>test P! Lorem ipsum etc. etc. etc. A yellow 'be aware' weather warning has been re-introduced in parts of Wales.
The Met Office has issued a new warning for parts of mid, south and west Wales from 04:00 GMT on Sunday until 14:00.
Heavy rain is due in the morning, followed by heavy showers. Flooding has been reported on many roads in the Dyfed-Powys Police force area.
The Met Office warned a greater risk of localised flooding than normal might be expected given the already saturated ground following weeks of heavy rain.
Dyfed-Powys Police tweeted there was flooding on the A40 both between Corner Piece Inn and Puncheston, Pembrokeshire, and near Talybont-on-Usk, Powys.
The force also said there was flooding on the A479 at Cwmdu and the A4138 at Talyclun, both Carmarthenshire, and just off junction 48 of the M4 at Pontarddulais.
Officers in the area also warned of flooding on many smaller roads, as well as surface water.
Natural Resources Wales has one flood warning in effect for the Lower Dee valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows, as well as four flood alerts.
The weather warning covers Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan.</p>
